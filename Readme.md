## USING THIS TEMPLATE:

- Make sure to run npm install

- rename the template.env to .env

- auth.js has most of the auth middleware logic built out, just create a verify user function based on your particular database setup.

- cors whitelist defined in config/cors.js, when in a non-production environment it will allow all traffic, in production it will work off the whitelist.

## Commands

```npm run dev``` run dev server look for env.yaml for environmental variables

```npm run start``` run in production more, not look for env.yaml
